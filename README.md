**Notice: this project is now stalled and will be rebooted again once I reimplement [Wren](https://wren.io) interpereter in Zig for more felxibility.**
This project was originally supposed to use Wren as scripting language, but switched to Lua because of limitations of offical WrenVM implementation. Now I have learned that Lua is no different...

# ðŸŒ• wmoon

wmoon is a Wayland window manager in spirit of [awesome](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome), written in Zig.
It's fully scriptable with [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org) (but you can use pure Lua if you insist).
Project started as a fork of [river](https://https://github.com/riverwm/river) by Isaac Freund.

*Note: wmoon is currently work in progress. Expect incomplete API, 
and WIP features.*
